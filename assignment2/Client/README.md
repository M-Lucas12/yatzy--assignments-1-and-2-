# Yatzy Game – Assignment 2 (Node.js + Express)

This folder contains the **Assignment 2** version of my Yatzy game.
The goal is to move the game logic and state management to a Node.js /
Express server and use the **Fetch API** on the client to talk to it.

## 1. Server Setup

From the `assignment2` folder:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express cors
# (optional for development)
npm install --save-dev nodemon
